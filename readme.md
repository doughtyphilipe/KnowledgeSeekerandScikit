# Knowledge Seeker

The Knowledge Seeker Method, originally described in [Knowledge Seeker - Ontology Modelling for Information Search and Management](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-17916-7), was applied in German Industry Norms ([DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Institut_f%C3%BCr_Normung)). This thesis debates the usage, the hurdles and algorithm behind this method. The results can be found in the knowledge_seeker.ipynb file.


# Scikit

The Scikit methods for text classification are broadly debated [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html). We applied and disscused the diferences between these methods and the Knowledge Seeker method. The results can be found in the norm_classifier.ipynb file.

## Installation

Scikit can be installed as follows.

```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

Importing in a python file.

```python
import sklearn
```
